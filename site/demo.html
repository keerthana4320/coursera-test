		<p>The famous Hari Mandir or Golden Temple in Amritsar, Punjab, is the astonishingly beautiful centre of Sikhism in India. Gleaming bright and seeming to float on the sacred lake that surrounds it, the temple and its surrounding complex has been visited by millions of pilgrims down the centuries, and today, respectful travellers are welcomed into this precious place, to admire it, enjoy it and meet the Sikhs who hold it dear.</p>
